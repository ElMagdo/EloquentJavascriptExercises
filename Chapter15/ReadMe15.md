# Balloon  

Write a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, ðŸŽˆ ). When you
press the `up arrow`, it should **inflate** (grow) 10 percent, and when you press the
`down arrow`, it should **deflate** (shrink) 10 percent.  
You can control the size of text (emoji are text) by setting the `font-size`
CSS property (`style.fontSize`) on its parent element. *Remember to include a
unit in the value*â€”for example, pixels (`10px`).  
The key names of the arrow keys are "`ArrowUp`" and "`ArrowDown`". Make sure
the keys change only the balloon, without scrolling the page.  
When that works, add a feature where, if you blow up the balloon past a
certain size, it explodes. In this case, exploding means that it is replaced with
an ðŸ’¥ emoji, and the event handler is removed (so that you canâ€™t inflate or
deflate the explosion).
